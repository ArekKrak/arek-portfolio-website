A responsive website built as a kanban project — part of a broader Full-Stack Web Development programme.

This portfolio website showcases my profile, goals, and projects as a full-stack developer in training, featuring:

- A home page with an AI generated image, a medieval version of myself gradually turning into my original, modern version of myself upon hover or click - a JavaScript functionality
- An "About Me" page where I introduce myself and present programming technologies I'm familiar with
- Visuals, CTA buttons, and layout that adapts seamlessly to screen size

## Project Overview

This project was the culmination of a front-end development module, focused on HTML5 and CSS3 responsive design principles. It required the practical application of:

- Media queries
- Relative units (`em`, `rem`, `%`)
- Fluid image resizing
- Flexbox layout and positioning

The project brief came from the Codecademy **Responsive Club Website** challenge project. It was open-ended, emphasizing creative decision-making, real-world layout planning, and problem solving.
