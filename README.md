A responsive website built as a kanban project — part of a broader Full-Stack Web Development programme.

This portfolio website showcases my profile, goals, and projects as a full-stack developer in training, featuring:

- A home page showing an AI generated image of a portrait, a medieval version of myself gradually crossfading into my original, modern version of myself upon hover or click - a JavaScript functionality demonstrated. The medieval version of myself will be replaced one day with a more professional version, as I currently consider it a fancy feature of my website, part of the project from my course
- An "About Me" page where I introduced myself and presented programming technologies I'm familiar with
- A "Projects" page showcasing my most compelling (so far) projects
- A contact page where you can use one of the options available to get in touch with me
- JavaScript functionality like the-already-mentioned image crossfade style, dark/light mode, and the rotating background

I designate this Portfolio website as Vol. 1, as it will be evolving over time and more projects will be added.

## Project Overview

This project was the consolidation of my learning, focused on HTML5, CSS3 responsive design principles, and JavaScript functionality. It required the practical application of:

- HTML & CSS
- At least one interactive feature using JavaScript
- Git version control
- The command line and file navigation

The project brief came from the Codecademy **Portfolio Website** kanban project. It was open-ended, emphasizing creative decision-making, real-world layout planning, and problem solving.
